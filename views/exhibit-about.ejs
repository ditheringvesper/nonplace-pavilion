            Welcome back, User.
            </b>
            <br><br><br><br>
    
    
            <i>nonplace.site</i> is a browser-based project that grows over time. It began with a simple idea of hosting a little digital space open for all unexpected encounters, where a sense of familiarity is curated to all visitors yet yields no clear ownership or identity. 
            <br><br>
            In 2023, I developed this idea into a website as my graduate degree <b><a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2023/projects/?student-id=135">thesis project</a></b>, embedded with more contextual research, specifically, digital memory and hybrid belongingness. No one seems to be the sole owner behind the homogenized interface, whereas the parallel of a personal space and a nameless perspective fills the gap with our own experience, rendering a soft and blank canvas that merges us into collective memories.
            <br><br>
            Currently, <i>nonplace.site</i> is an online pavilion as part of <i><b>The Wrong Biennale</b></i>, on view from November 1, 2023 to March 1, 2024. Taking this opportunity, <i>nonplace.site</i> has been adapted into a collective space that showcases various forms of digital work by different individuals, which actualizes its fundamental concept that merges the public and the personal. 
            <br>
            I'm grateful to all the supports that I am fortunate to receive along the way, especially, my co-curator and dear friend Yan Shao, all the artists and friends who participated in the exhibition, and undoubtedly, The Wrong Biennale. 
    
            <br><br>
            Hope you enjoy this nonplace :D
