I want to express the pain of regret I feel from allowing my friendships to atrophy through neglect and how similar that regret is to all of the works I've lost to bit rot or poor archival practices. The fact that I was able to restore the game and renew it for modern technologies gives me hope that I can do the same for the relationships in my life I have neglected. It is not too late."},"_id":"con-cameronalexander"}

My grandfather started recording our family gatherings around 20 years ago with VHS tapes. These tapes were then burned onto DVDs, and stored in a feather suitcase at home. Later the DVDs were digitized onto a hard drive, and for this project, footages were uploaded to a cloud drive and formatted. These footages and files were being reformatted from time to time, from analog to digital, across a long distance of time and space. As the pixels were stretched, compressed, transformed, and lost through migrations, so were my memories and the retrospective construction of myself and home over time. Revisiting the past, separated by two decades and over 7,000 miles, I attempted to reconcile the present self with the distant memories, intertwining diasporic cultural and family attachments with glitched identities. By reversing the videos back to analog signals and manipulating the glitches, I arranged and confronted fragments of the past, searching for a sense of place and belonging in the lost memories, and in the part of me that was left in the suitcase in that distant small town."},"_id":"con-jingyaoshao"}

Each click conjures a memory: a journal excerpt about their first menstruation is eclipsed by a photo of their younger self with puckered lips, which in turn disappears under a still from a PowerPoint presentation arranged to look like an online blog. These glimpses coalesce into a haze as the accompanying voice considers the implications of un-identifying with their past. “Residue” is an invitation for both the artist and visitors to regard their past selves in a more forgiving light. It is a meditation on the malleability of the individual and the need to accept that which makes us cringe."},"_id":"con-josuk"}

While this photograph represents one of my earliest DSLR endeavors, it remains shrouded in forgetfulness, void of any accompanying memories. Leveraging AI-generated images by Photoshop, the project delves into a realm of imagination, where the absence of personal recollections tied to the image's genesis paves the way for exploring infinite possibilities within the constraints of accessible AI technology. By drawing an analogy between technological advancements (AI) and the dynamic evolution of cities, the project probes the reliability of memory and the profound implications of technology reshaping our perception of the past. \"21 4:22pm Variation 00-60\" attempts to showcase how AI-generated images can reconstruct and reinterpret our personal histories, unveiling fresh perspectives on urban development and self-discovery throughout the passage of time."},"_id":"con-peixuanouyang"}

The piece explores the trajectory of a Honda Civic's life through found video housed in a steel structure. Videos include footage of an iron ore mine, a home video of a woman showing her new Honda Civic to family and friends, and footage of a Civic being meticulously scrapped. As the viewer moves around the sculpture, the audio of the woman sharing details of her new car bleeds into the other footage. The three points of the Civic's life collapse into each other, held together by her conversation. Honda Civic Triptych comes from the artist's relationship to their own late Honda Civic as a generational heirloom, one passed down from their late grandfather. "},"_id":"con-samzanowski"}

Inspired by the decay can cracking of the painting Black Square by Kazimir Malevich, #000000 square begins as a black square sized 80 * 80 pixels (displayed as 79.5 * 79.5, referring to the dimension of Black Square in centimeters), which are encoded as 153600 zero bits, (80*80 pixels * 3 color channels * 8 bits per color value) and displayed through bitmapping. Every day, a random bit would flip to its opposite, changing the color of the corresponding pixel, adding artifacts of decaying to the painting. Additionally, the randomization algorithm used is computationally expensive and thus it would take longer to compute the painting as it ages. The initial date of the painting is set to December 9, 1968, the date of the demonstration of the oN-Line System (NSL), which is the basis of modern personal computers and the first commercial prototype that implements bitmapping for image display. The project is written with p5.js and hosted through GitHub Pages."},"_id":"con-sylviake"}

The dome-shaped structure keeps a new environment to the barnacles and transforms the otherwise dead into a self-perpetuating rotating hemisphere.
